<p style="text-indent: 30px; font-family: 'Macondo', cursive;">
Soooooo Welcome to my Journey, lets try and back track a little, if im in the 12th grade right now, and met a friend in the 9th, i say this because later on in the story youll realize what i was talking about. currently in the year 2025 im in the process of sobriety, i went sober 1/2/25. Alrightt. If in the year 2025 im in the 12th. meaning in the year 2021-2022, i was in the 9th grade. Thats the year i started to hit substances hard. Everything went and was going well that year, that was my junior high year. I came from Mann Magnet Middle School. You might be asking yourself, how did i end up in Bryant, coming from Little Rock. we'll that'll be a story for another time, coming from a very dark family incident. Anyways i had to move to Bryant due to family issues. So here i am, Junior High year 9th grade. It was kinda a scary experience because i had alot of enemies in that district. LITTLE ROCK AND BRYANT DOES NOT GET ALONG. So when it came to registrating and joining the school. i thought i wasn't gonna have any friends and was gonna have a hard time making some. But to be honest. it wasn't that bad, this school was a pretty good school. from Food to teachers. nothing was really bad about this school. welp, i started to skip, and after the first few times. i ended up learning the administrators paths, i learned when i needed to leave, when the cameras weren't being watched. I never got caught. not once. that really did affect my grades. you might ask yourself why? well, i was never in class. i missed alot of class lessons and was with friends goofing around in bathrooms and hotboxing them. I DO REGRET IT, EVERY SINGLE BIT. if i can recall, not exactly. I had 1st period Algebra- YEPP :(... they gave me math first period SMHH LOL. but in that class, they gave us seating charts, and of course. the new student. Got sent to the front of the class. mane these kids where just smarter bro, and thats my fault because i never paid attention. and if you knew me youd understand why... well here i am in 2021 at the front of the class. Every morning we had this one thing named Bell Ringers, which we had 5 mins to answer after the bell rang, and of course this wasn't nothing VOLUNTAIRLY. THE TEACHER EVERY MORNING HAD A RANDOM NUMBER GENERATOR FROM SEAT 1 TO 35. BRUHHHHH, yeahhhh bruhhhh... straight luck or bad luck. MANN.. when i tell you i wished so hard every morning to never get picked up, mann how big is the Lord. NOT ONCE THAT YEAR THE NUMBER GENERATOR CHOSE SEAT 3. HOLYYYY. i had incredible luck that year. Alrightt. soo having that in mind, i never wanted to go to class. everyone would just look at the new student, the level of anxiety id have. it was the avg human anxiety but its school. so i never really cared. if something bored me. i just wouldn't go to class. So here we are, all caught up on this junior high year so far. when id skip, id be in bathrooms with homies hitting blinkers back in forth just getting absolutely faded in those bathrooms. i couldve never imagined how hard itd end up hitting me later in life. my anxiety at the time wasn't that bad. like i said if something bothered.. why keep doin or going?!? so i did my own thang and ended up smoking alot. i did realize my anxiety rose, how i noticed was this girl would always stare at me, man she was the class BOP 😭... so i was like ohhh shyeeetttt. excuse my language. and it started with my eyes getting watery every time id see a girl that would stare at me. so its obvious that when your eyes get watery, that person.. you know? and it just got worse from that, not in that time, id smoke and the fact that my eyes would get "red"... i would feel soooo much better. the fact that people could notice i was high. i was like yeahhhh. so thatd bring attention, plus it gave some reputation. also in that time smoking was actually a way i used to cope with my anxiety and what not. but it wasn't that bad. just simple, id get nervous i guess or feel uncomfortable. well that was junior high year, As i was saying in the beginning, now were in the year 2022-23. Being the 10th grade, as far as i can remember. in the 9th grade. I pulled so much reputation. but ima catch you up🤭.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px; font-family: 'Macondo', cursive;">
The beginning of 10th grade year, i had first period English class. that class was the easiest and the best class i had, i would sit in a table with one of my 2 best friends i used to have[NO LONGER FRIENDS BUT 🤷] neither of those would smoke, sadly i influenced them into. but i didn't force them, theyd see me come under the influence into class. and it was just time before they noticed. So in that class like half that year everything was going well, i had good classes and all. i didn't have as many friends. and keep in mind i was smoking. so half that year i somehow managed to catch a personal issue. and as far back i want to recall, as much as i want to remember where did everything happen. i just cant. I JUST CANTT REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED. it couldve been from me being laced a couple times. to probably me being mentally screwed over by friends. but oh well. i just wish to acknowledge what happened. to this day it torments me because if i cant find out what happened, i cant find out the solution. i blame the smoking, which includes my mental health. well. in the my 10th grade year, i didn't care but smoke all day. I MEAN ALL DAY. EVERY MINUTE, EVERY CLASS. EVERY SECOND. if the hire wore off, id walk out of the class and go to the bathroom get me my hits, mannn... my classmates would just stare at me howd id come back into class just absolutely faded😂. I lowkey feel like they realized something went wrong with me. because thats the year my anxiety hit me hardest. before it hit hardest. i would skip school and class. both. Keep in mind in had some friend named sebas, i might bring him up a couple times. that was my mane friend. that was my closest friend. im talking about he would pick me up before and drop me off from school. i met him in my class Welding 1A-SCCC-S1. i met him over a oldfriend named ronny. to be honest, i never knew me and that dude were gonna become close. and it was the smoking who united us😂. well, i started skipping because why not right? i had so much money bro, im talking about i didn't buy any clothes, i felt like i didn't need too. i went to school the whole year with like 5 pairs of Air Forces and like 5 pairs of jeans, the shirts where just covered my jackets and hoodies, i only had a couple too. Now, keep in mind every cart was 45$, and still is, I would buy one Every other day, say i bought one today, i finished it tomorrow, and bought a new one the day after. Mane these kids caught up soon, aye GG you got that thangg on you?!?. You already know dawgg! *CHIEEEFFF*😂. well thats how i made friends, everyone ended up knowing me as GG and the guy with the pen. i would get everybody right, what id hate was people would bring their shyeet and wouldn't letme hit, but i dont judge, broke ass dudes couldn't afford any more so im like.. Oh you frr? you not gon letme hit that shyeet?. well i didn't care, i only missed bringing one to school a couple days, i made sure to remember their faces, me and sebas would remember they faces, LIKE NAHHHHH I REMEMBER YOU PERFECTLY YOU NOT GETTING RIGHT OFF ME. Later that year school got lame, i decided to force sebas to skip school with me😂. MANE IF YOU DONT BELIEVE ME, I MEAN NO ONE WOULD DRIVE YOU ANYWHERE WITHOUT GAS MONEY, SCREW THE GAS MONEY, why skip if you cant go anywhere fun?!?. Mann... i mean I was single, i wasn't in a relationship, i didn't have anything to worry about. not if a girl liked me or if i was a bad image towards them. i was living life. [THE ENEMY HAD THE LIVING LIKE THAT] trust me... I caught all up to me💔. Me and old broski, we'd end up going to eat, going to smoke to parks, going to the movies, going to stores and just messing around. but as long as we weren't in school we was chilling. We'd be so high[FADED]everything was 10x better. Now bro didn't have money, but me being the real friend. i never cared, as long as you where my friend, my money was your money. if you didn't have money to eat, id have your back. but i wouldn't let you starve around me💔. Keep in mind, bro didn't smoke. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px; font-family: 'Macondo', cursive;">
I accidentally also influenced bro into becoming a bad person. and im sorry bro i really am. but i had the plugs, i had the money, ID BUY THE PRODUCT. why would he do all that? he wouldn't. i would... I've been touching paper since 13, but family issues and what not, i never knew how to save or invest. i was also never into designer clothes. eventually i did get into all that. but dont let society trick you. so that whole year i was never in school. and for some reason. i caught a problem. i mean i just caught all yall up to my life so far... WHAT COULDVE GONE WRONG BRO?!? I DONT KNOWW, ALL I DID WAS SMOKE AND SMOKE AND I GUESS IT GOT TO ME💔. After all this, i was forced to not go to class due to something called Truency, which is when you pay a fine or end up getting locked up for missing so many school days, i got multiple letters home and never listened. I ended up getting away with it. the last quater of the 10th grade, that whole last semester i never went back into a class. and when i felt like going into that class, because i knew i was cooked... i didnt because of a gut feeling. instead i was skipping on campus because as yall know, Sebas wasnt anything like me. he had different plans obviously, he couldnt do what i could. he wasnt gonna risk it. but me onda other side. i knew that if i went to class, a administrator could come dragging me out😂. the classes i chose not to go into, i skipped in seperate buildings, they had a total. if im still correct like 18 buildings, making building 10 the biggest. 17 the most known for skipping, 8 the one with principles in, they had their own bathrooms. even though that building was their building. they wouldnt dare walk into that bathroom, them having theirs. building 8 and 17 didnt have smoking sensors, they'd get hotboxed every day, im talking about everyday if one bathroom wasnt being smoked in it was the other one. Anyways i kept myself hopping around bathrooms rotating positions throughout the day, lunch being veryy risky because every administrator looking for me was just chilling there. so that was my 10th grade year, i skipped like i said, half the year 😂. Now, i never stopped smoking until the year 2025, it took in the date 1/2/2025, January 2nd. So moving onto the year 2024. So if you noticed, my 10th grade year took place in the year 2023. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px; font-family: 'Macondo', cursive;">
Now year 2023-24, I remember having so much anxiety, due to i stopped smoking and since i went without it after being on it for such a long period. It got to me, it got worse in the summer after the 10th grade, i remember begging my mother to Enroll me into a online school program, which she never did. i begged at her and told her trust me if you help me out here ima start working and help her with money but i cant go back to school. it hit me so hard it got to me physically, i cant explain but i once told this Beautiful Girl named Julie, that i will later on talk about. anyways, i still hadnt met her yet, not yett. Shouldve found me earlier mamass. before all this happened and crashed my life down. Well, My mom never helped me enroll, i took my time and found the documents needed to enroll. There was so many documents to turn in, they werent anything difficult, but difficult to find😭. I took my time and found every document, i indeed did tell my mom i was enrolling she did end up helping my taking me to go get my immunization record and my transcript, also i had to go up to the school personally and had to still wait until the school told them i was good to go, i was reading to be withdrawn from Bryant High School district. That was the end of thattt. So here i am now. Doin school in year 2024 in a online school program. Its not bad at all. its pretty easy and they love to keep it simple. just do you work and what not. Noww. 4/23. 3 days after the big smoking party i had, i hopped on cod, yeahh loll codm. 4/23 making it April 23. If yall know April 20th (4/20), is considered as an occasion for smoking or celebrating the smoking of marijuana. well 3 days after i never knew id met a friend on a game. KEEP IN MIND SHE WAS A FRIEND. nowww. it all started with me flirting with other girls, but of course i dont know them. i was hitting my pen and laughing my ass off. I NEVER WOULDVE THOUGHT I WOULD HAVE TO BE IN THIS SITUATION😂. But yeahh, it started from me talking about doing a girl on the world chat😂, the girl went quiet and i said yall dont worry i get "them" in the corner. like in the corner of my room HAHAHA. they went along and all. All of a sudden, i seen a name pop up on the chat, Julies17. Me and her ended up talking little i was like julies in the corner too LOL. they went along and all that. well Julie ended up adding me. Man i was so paranoid. i thought she was a setup, but genuinely she was a person who wanted a friend or who knows LOL. but we ended up talking and giving socials. We took it pretty far in the jokes, i ended up telling her my personal problems and she told me hers. We ended up becoming friends, and just for some reason she decided it to take it far. She skipped the whole talking process. We just dove right into it. We ended up getting attached, we ended up catching feelings💔Who knows if she even still feels the same way, but i promise i can almost remember everything. I really got attached to this girl. We ended up calling alot, we ended up texting every minute of the day. We couldn't go or do anything without the other piece. Well after a few weeks of straight calling i think i ended up telling her how i felt or she told me i cant really recall but its like we just clicked, we skipped it. WE LOCKED IN HARD. I mean yall seen the way we met, i wasn't looking for anyone, they just came across. I didn't even know her. for a while i thought she was a robot typing to me. I would be like HOW DO I KNOW YOUR NOT SOME ROBOT JUST TRYNA TRICK ME. im not theres no way ima fall in love with a person or what ever that was. After a few weeks again we ended up showing how we look like and MANNN!!! HOWW BEAUTIFULL THIS GIRLL WASSSS. and this girl was surprisingly 1 1/2 years under me. LIKE WHATTTT. This interaction was crazy, so there was no way i left it at that. i tried to see how far itd go, and bro. Me and this girl ended up dating. its crazy how id never do anything like that but this girll made me foldddd. She was respectful and i was obviously respectful. This beautiful girl i knew back then as Juliet. I could tell this girl had serious issues going on with her. not mentally but like people would be rude to her and would be mean to her. they would hurt her. BY ISSUES I MEANT PEOPLE WOULD GIVE THEM TO HER. This genuinely nice, most perfect girl i knew in short period of time. She would always apologize to me, or to anyone. I met this girl when SHE WAS BROKEN. Daily i would tell her, please and i really mean it baby, Please stop apologizing, you never did anything wrong. you ever did and never are. You aren't the issue and you shouldn't apologize for something you should do. If yall were to meet this girl now. Yall would see how much she progressed in life, from being the scared little girl she wass, I PREPARED HER MAN. I HELPED HER GAIN CONFIDENCE. I HELPED HER GET STRONGER. ill never forget it man. Shes no longer the same, but to be honest i rather see her feeling freely and not a prisoner of being shamed, of being bullied, and of being pushed around. I tried my best to help her gain confidence. For her it isn't a big thing because shes "FREE" she'll never think the same as before, and its not a problem my little girl. Keep pushing in there❤️. DONT LET ANYONE DISRESPECT YOU, DONT LET ANYONE TRY TO DOMINATE YOU. You have control of your self, dont let anyone talk over you. Dont let anyone try to hurt you with words, they're just words. They're just people who attack the weak to feel better. you'll never see them preying on people bigger, they always prey on the weaker ones. Well im actually soo happy shes free now. im proud for giving her strength, im proud of helping you improve your strength significantly. That was one of the best moments of my life, she probably cant remember. but i definitely remember. I just hope she doesn't give up in there❤️. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px; font-family: 'Macondo', cursive;">
For the next few months, sorry i cant really provide dates, but to keep it simply im now taking place from 4/23/2024 to 1/18/2025. Present. Ever since i met this girl, we've have up and downs. At the beginning we had the most beautiful memories, we'd spend so much time talking and make the best out of them. I would love making her laugh. I would love to make her smile. Trust i know when i make someone smile. over text or by their voice. So for the next few months we'd have a strong connection but slowly we were falling apart. I would remember how much id smoke and im pretty sure i used to hurt this poor girl man.. I regret if i did. i didnt know what i was doing. If i remember, i was never sober when i was dating her. Most of the times wed call, we would call and have amazing coversations, how are you? what you doingg? and from there on. the first few months few amazing. after that, we had sum difficult times. We'd be calling over the phone. We'd make eachother cry💔. and im genuinely sorry for all that, she doesnt know. but what hurt me most was to hear her crying. Thatd hurt me so much because i knew i was doing wrong but couldnt tell what i was doing wrong, when i tell you id just be outside talking to this beautiful girl over the phone just smoking as shed cry, id go mute man. this shit would kill me, THISS SHITT WOULDD KILL MEE BROO. i remember how i would feel. At points i would feel like my heart would stop beating. I would have these strong feelings in my chest. They werent describable. But thats how i knew i was deepy in love with this girl. I would tell my self FUCKK BROO. you really love this girl. dont even know her in real life, and already felt like if i met her before. Shed probably call me crazy, but man. i was just attached. I can remember going to sleep on calls, and i would be outside smoking, telling her. Soon i'll be with you, ill talk to her in her sleep, mane this girl would be deeply sleeping, i would be crying talking to her mind❤️I WAS TALKING TO THAT SOUL. i know that soul could hear me. i would be like baby, im sorry for everything, soon ill stop smoking and we will better things and proceed, im pretty sure she was asleep. id die of tears and she can confirm she recalls. Because i would always do that. We'd fall asleep on the phone, and id hear her crying while she slept, bro THAT KILLED ME BRO. as much as i tried to wake her up i knew i couldnt. AND I BLAME MY SELF FOR THAT. I FEEL LIKE IM THE REASON SHE WAS SUFFERING. I MUSTVE BEEN A HORRIBLE PERSON. we lived good moments. but for her to cry while sleeping. I HATED MYSELF BRO. I STILL DO. I HOPE YALL KNOW IM TEARING WHILE WRITING THIS. I never wished to hurt this girl. If yall could read my mind. I was going through a deep and i mean a HARD TIME IN MY LIFE. i had withdrawls that no one could ever get, id go to doctors and theyd tell me they couldnt do anything about it. and i would tell this beautiful girl i dont know what to do, im lost. i gotta smoke to feel this way. i remember her telling me she feels bad because she knows i have to smoke in order to feel a certain way. This killed me mane. No matter what, no matter how much i wanna change that. She'll always see me as that little pathetic fucking addict. im not shit mane. i never wished to hurt her. I tried my best to treat her the best i could. I tried my best to change the ways i live, for over a year ive wanted to stop smoking and get my life together, I could be with this girl right now💔...</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px; font-family: 'Macondo', cursive;">
I didn't really always smoke because of my issue, i would also go out and light me on up everytime i missed her. Itd kill me how i couldnt do anything about it. no matter what i couldnt give her a hug nothing. We'd have arguements to the point Itd torment me, i didnt know what kept be pushing, i dont know what inside me kept telling me to stay with this girl. Luckily i did stay with her. But besides the beautiful and heartwarming moments. We'd also have down falls, i hope she reads this. These moments would kill mee. all i could do is smoke. I was at the point where i didnt know if she really loved me. So i was stuck in a situation where i didnt know if she really loved me, for all i knew. She couldve just been fucking with my mind. So id smoke and stress out not knowing my next move.. not knowing what to do. But i never gave up on her❤️. Not everything was my fault or on my side, she'd do things that'll kill me. But of course, when a guy loved a girl a lot, they really dont care. So i really never gave up on her. But itd kill me because i didnt know if she really even still loved me. At first it was noticable that she really loved me. But after time. i feel like she was slowly seperating from me. So yeahh i would smoke and not stop. As muchh as i wanted to quit and get my life together. I couldn't. i tried and tried, and ended up doing horrible things. from stealing to borrowing money from friends that are no longer with me. One thing about me is i keep my word. Those who'd have my back. id have theirs back. Sadly they only knew my during my addiction. Ill never forget those to be honest. I will bless them later in life. May the Lord forgive my profanity. ill keep words clean from now on. But after a while. i decided to actually go sober this year, Sadly i dont know if ima end up Marrying this Girl, or if ima sadly have to move on. It really kills me because after all this. im actually starting to recover and gain the strength to move on if i had to. I ended up locking in, i ended up pointing my life towards God, which kept me going. I shouldnt wanna die or a girl to be honest. All you need in this Life is God. after all, you wont take anything with you to the grave. So yeahh i quit smoking, soo yeahh i pointed my life towards God. Im hopeing and HAVE FAITH that GOD will help me and Julie succeed in life. Together or not. I hope God really keeps me with this girl. I just hope God hasnt been trying to tell me something this whole time. I just hope God hasnt been tryna reveal to me that maybe this isnt the right choice for me. To be honest i just hope it isnt that. I ask God to pleaseee give me this girl and help me go to Church with her one day. I met her and i just cant let her go like that. I stopped smoking with Gods help, im sorry baby it took this long🎀. but im starting to lock in. I wont be wasting my money on dumb stuff. i wont be the same guy i used to be before. Im really hoping to move forward and straight success.</p>
